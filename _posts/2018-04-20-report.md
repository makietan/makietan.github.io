Recently, Facebook account leak news is widely announced
by the media.
So, I follow trends. I searched classmates in Facebook.

Finding about, It was very interest!

Many people icon is their baby photo.
Maybe they marriaged.
A part of party people was not showy in Facebook.
There were classmetes I don't find account.

Finaly, their most account is inactive.

Facebook is died.
